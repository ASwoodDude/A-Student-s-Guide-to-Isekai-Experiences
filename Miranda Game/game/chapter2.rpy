    m "I am riding in the back of a cart clattering down a cobblestone street, jostling around with unidentified bags that seem like grain."

    m "The city around me is bright and bustling. People dressed in European Renaissance-style clothing scatter this way and that, and a sour smell permeates my nose that I soon realize is coming from the horses pulling the cart."
    
    m "My arms and legs tingle with something like numbness, and I look down to see myself in unfamiliar clothing— the same clothing as the avatar I picked only moments ago. I poke at my arms and legs as the numbness fades, pinching and prodding."
    
    m "Maybe I fell asleep? Maybe something knocked me unconscious?"
    
    m "I scratch at my arm. A red line wells up. I do not wake up."
    
    m "I bite my lower lip. Hard. The iron taste of blood hits my tongue and I wince at the sting."
    
    m "I do not wake up."
